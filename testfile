Not all terminal support blinking, and dim too. Before i think there are only 16 colors support. But now I see 256 are.
It's very good. But for 16 only you may design
pseudo graphic interface, draw good windows and all graphical controls in text mode. Only you
need(for russians) use DOS866 encodding set. It containe full set of pseudo graphic symbols, others no. There is set
of libraries of pseudo graphic controls. And you may easily make TUI(text user interface) API like GUI. But
library is Turbo Vision for DOS 16 only. But this libs in source code available. If you want you may rewrite them
for Linux platform. And if use 256 colors you get more better design nearest to GUI. Many years I try
to find redy solution but failed. So if you want to do that you need to all work by yourself. But result will
best. This API take tens times less resources and quicker then
gui. They don't require GUI regime at all... It will be best
But API of all. There is only 1 restriction. You don't must draw pictures, graphics, videos
and so on where you need pixel draw indeed. But there are little API like that. Most API don't need pixel draw at all.
